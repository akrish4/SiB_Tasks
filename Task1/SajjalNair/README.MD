## About me
I am a tech savvy individual who functions on coffee only. I have made some front-end heavy websites in ReactJS and have used GatsbyJS as CMS. Currently I am working on an open source project called NGless, by contributing more to the community on documentation and improving the HTML reports. 
I am a movie geek, who watches the movies with immense amount of passion and scrutiny and rate these movies accordingly on IMDb and more. I have created some lists too, which can be viewed by anyone who follows me on IMDb. There would be great reviews coming up in the future surely.
In my free time, I write about tech, framworks I have been using and maintain a blogging profile on Medium.
If I can aid anyone in learning something new, I would be more than happy to do that.
